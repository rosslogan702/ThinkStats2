Think Stats - Chapter 2 Written Discussion Exercises

Exercise 2-1 

Question:
Based on the results in this chapter, supposed you were asked to summarize what you learned about whether first babies arrive late.

Which summary statistics would you use if you wanted to get a story on the evening news? Which ones would you use if you wanted to reassure an axious patient?

Finally, image that you are Cecil Adams, author of "The Straight Dope" (http://straightdope.com), and your job is to answer the question, "Do first babies arrive late?" Write a paragraph that uses the results in this chapter to answer the question clearly, precisely and honestly.

Story on the Evening News
= = = = = = = = = = = = = =

If I were aiming to get a story on the evening news, the summary statistics that I would use would be the ones that would suggest that first babies do indeed arrive late.

The mean pregnancy length for first babies was calculated at 38.601; for other babies it is 38.523. 
This would seem to indicate that typically the first pregnancy length is likely to be longer than for other babies.
From the perspective of writing a headline for a news story, it would be factually correct to say that the mean pregnancy length for first babies than other babies (2nd, 3rd, 4th) is longer.
However this approach fails to look into what this difference means and just takes the numbers at face value.

Re-assuring an Anxious Patient
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

If I were re-assuring an anxious patient I would report that the mean value of the pregnancy length for first babies is 38.601 and the mean pregnancy length for other babies is 38.523.

This difference is 0.078 weeks, which works out to 13 hours. 

Also as a fraction of the typical pregnancy length this difference is about 0.2%. 

In practical terms, the 13 hours difference is probably more relatable to the patient in that this gives them a quantifiable number of 13 hours which isn't too much longer than the other babies mean pregnancy length. 

In addition, when you consider that a typical pregnancy length calculated from the dataset is 38.6 weeks, 13 hours extra is small compared to the overall pregnancy length.

"The Straight Dope Version"
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

If I were writing a concise article for the straight dope which was clear, precise and honest I would indicate the following:

- The mean value of pregnancy length for first babies is slightly longer than for other babies by 0.078 weeks which works out to 13 hours.
- From the typical pregnancy length this difference is around 0.2%
- Calculating cohen's d statistic (comparing the difference between the groups to the variability within the groups), we get 0.029 standard deviations
	- This is a small difference and to put that in perspective the d statistic for difference between men and women's heights is 1.7

The overall advice in the chapter seems to be if you are trying to demonstrate the important of an effect, you might choose summary statistics that emphasise differences. 

Where as if you are trying to re-assure patient you might choose statistics that put the differences in contexts and make them relatable to the patient to re-assure them.
